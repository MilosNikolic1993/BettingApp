Application Description
Functionality:

The application simulates a betting system where users can register, check their balance, select teams to bet on, and place bets based on odds calculated from the teams' strengths.
Users can choose a team, input their desired bet amount, and simulate a match. Depending on the outcome, their balance is updated to reflect wins or losses.
Users are prompted to continue betting or exit the application, with options to top up their balance if they run out of funds.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Java: The programming language used to implement the betting application.
Scanner: A utility from the java.util package to handle user input from the console.
Random: A class from java.util used to simulate random match outcomes and generate scores for teams.
HashMap: A data structure from java.util that stores user information (username and balance) in key-value pairs.
